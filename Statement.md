*Problem Statement 

This project deals with Breadth First Search algorithms to solve 8 puzzle problems.The core problem is to be solved in shortest moves or optimal path to reach the defined goal state.

*Scope of the project

This project is scoped to show the execution of the Breadth First Search algorithms to solve 8 puzzle problem.It is educational based rather than optimised for performance.

*Target users

This project is mainly for the individuals,students or teachers who are interested in or studying fundamental concepts in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

*High-level features

It guarantees an optimal solution.
It stores and prints sequences of moves from initial state to goal state.
It explores all the possible configurations until goal state is reached.

                                       Puzzle Solver Using Breadth First Search


*Overview of the project:-  
This project executed a solution for puzzle problems using the “Breadth First Search” algorithm which uses FIFO(first in,first out).This puzzle is made on a 3x3 matrix with eight numbers and one empty space(0) which can move up, down, left and rightThe goal is to arrange the given initial state into a predefined goal state by repeatedly moving the number into the adjacent empty space.


*Features:-  
BFS will provide a solution if one is available.  
It will find the simplest one solution that needs few steps.  
This program uses the BFS algorithm which guarantees an optimal solution.  
It stores and prints sequences of moves from initial state to goal state.
It tracks the number of states explored and search depth.


*Technologies/tools used:-  
Programming Language:- Python  
Libraries:- copy

*Steps to install & run the project:-  
Install python latest version.  
Download the code file and save the file project.py.  
Open the file in Terminal or Any IDEs like VScode.  
Run the code.

*Instruction For Testing:-  
Use a simple initial state as if it gets complex,maybe it takes a lot of time and memory to generate goal result.
